        The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Rock wins against scissors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scissors win against paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Paper wins against rock.
            </li>
        </ul>
